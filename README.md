 Introduction
E-commerce is fast gaining ground as an accepted and used business paradigm. 
More and more business houses are implementing web sites providing functionality for 
performing commercial transactions over the web. It is reasonable to say that the process 
of shopping on the web is becoming commonplace.
The objective of this project is to develop a general purpose e-commerce store 
where any product (such as books, CDs, computers, mobile phones, electronic items, and 
home appliances) can be bought from the comfort of home through the Internet. 
However, for implementation purposes, this paper will deal with an online book store.
An online store is a virtual store on the Internet where customers can browse the 
catalog and select products of interest. The selected items may be collected in a shopping 
cart. At checkout time, the items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order. At 
that time, more information will be needed to complete the transaction. Usually, the 
customer will be asked to fill or select a billing address, a shipping address, a shipping 
option, and payment information such as credit card number. An e-mail notification is 
sent to the customer as soon as the order is placed.
